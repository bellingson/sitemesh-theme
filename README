sitemesh-theme
------------------------------------------------------

This project extends sitemesh (http://www.opensymphony.com/sitemesh/) 
in order to enable the creation of website themes or private labels.

This package allows you to host multiple distinctively designed domains 
using a single web application.  

For certain use cases this enables: 
1) reusing front-end code and resources (HTML, CSS, images, etc)
2) speed deployment
3) scale (run multiple websites in one JVM without the overhead of multiple webapps)

Usage
